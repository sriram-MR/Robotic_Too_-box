# Robotic_Tool_box

This repo has set of MATLAB codes to find the physical parametrs of a fixed rigid body robot. This include program to find Kinematics, Dynamics and cntrol equations of the robots

To run this, open corresponding GUI files and give the required inputs. Inputs include, DH parameters, number of arms, types of arms etc.

Depencies, rvctools : roobot toolbox. add rvctools to the MATLAB depencies and run it beofre running these codes. THis was made using MATLAB 2019b.
